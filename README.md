# `caf` â€” Calculation framework

Caf is a general distributed build system written in Python 3.6, with focus on reproducible scientific calculations, inspired by [Waf](https://waf.io), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), and Git.

Caf is currently in the process of a major overhaul of the API. The up-to-date example usage of the new API can be seen [here](https://github.com/azag0/caf/blob/master/examples/aims/app.py).
